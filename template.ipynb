    "# Estimating COVID-19's $R_t$ in Real-Time\n",
    "Kevin Systrom - April 12\n",
    "\n",
    "In any epidemic, $R_t$ is the measure known as the effective reproduction number. It's the number of people who become infected per infectious person at time $t$. The most well-known version of this number is the basic reproduction number: $R_0$ when $t=0$. However, $R_0$ is a single measure that does not adapt with changes in behavior and restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a pandemic evolves, increasing restrictions (or potential releasing of restrictions) change $R_t$. Knowing the current $R_t$ is essential. When $R>1$, the pandemic will spread through the entire population. If $R_t<1$, the pandemic will grow to some fixed number less than the population. The lower $R_t$, the more manageable the situation. The value of $R_t$ helps us (1) understand how effective our measures have been controlling an outbreak and (2) gives us vital information about whether we should increase or reduce restrictions based on our competing goals of economic prosperity and human safety. [Well-respected epidemiologists argue](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/opinion/coronavirus-end-social-distancing.html) that tracking $R_t$ is the only way to manage through this crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, today, to my knowledge there is no real-time tracking of $R_t$ in United States. In fact, the only real-time measure I've seen has been for [Hong Kong](https://covid19.sph.hku.hk/dashboard). More importantly, it is not useful to understand $R_t$ at a national level. Instead, to manage this crisis effectively, we need a local (state, county and/or city) level granularity of $R_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows is a solution to this problem at the US State level. It's a modified version of a solution created by [Bettencourt & Ribeiro 2008](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002185) to estimate real-time $R_t$ using a Bayesian approach. While I have stayed true to most of their process, my solution differs in an important way that I will call out clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have questions, comments, or improvments feel free to get in touch: [hello@systrom.com](mailto:hello@systrom.com). And if it's not entirely clear, I'm not an epidemiologist. At the same time, data is data, and statistics are statistics and this is based on work by well-known epidemiologists so calibrate accordingly. In the meantime, I hope you can learn something new as I did by reading through this example. Feel free to take this work and apply it elsewhere – internationally or to counties in the United States."

    "## Bettencourt & Ribeiro's Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, we learn how many more people have COVID-19. This new case count gives us a clue about the current value of $R_t$. We also, figure that the value of $R_t$ today is related to the value of $R_{t-1}$ (yesterday's value) and every previous value of $R_{t-m}$ for that matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these insights, the authors use [Bayes' rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) to update their beliefs about the true value of $R_t$ based on how many new cases have been reported each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Bayes' Theorem as we'll use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(R_t|k)=\\frac{P(R_t)\\cdot\\mathcal{L}(k|R_t)}{P(k)} $$\n",
    "\n",

    "- times the __likelihood__ of seeing $k$ new cases given $R_t$ ...\n",
    "- divided by the probability of seeing this many cases in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, $P(k)$ is a constant, so the numerator is proportional to the posterior. Since all probability distributions sum to 1.0, we can ignore $P(k)$ and normalize our posterior to sum to 1.0:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(R_t|k) \\propto P(R_t) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(k|R_t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is for a single day. To make it iterative: every day that passes, we use yesterday's conclusion (ie. posterior) $P(k_{t-1}|R_{t-1})$ to be today's prior $P(R_t)$ so on day two:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(R_2|k) \\propto P(R_0)\\cdot\\mathcal{L}(k_2|R_2)\\cdot\\mathcal{L}(k_1|R_1) $$\n",

    "### My Proposed Modification\n",
    "\n",
    "This works fine, but it suffers from an issue: the posterior on any given day is equally influenced by the distant past as much as the recent day. For epidemics that have $R_t>1$ for a long time and then become under control ($R_t<1$), the posterior gets stuck. It cannot forget about the many days where $R_t>1$ so eventually $P(R_t|k)$ asymptotically approaches 1 when we know it's well under 1. The authors note this in the paper as a footnote. Unfortunately this won't work for us. __The most critical thing to know is when we've dipped below the 1.0 threshold!__\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I propose to only incorporate the last $m$ days of the likelihood function. By doing this, the algorithm's prior is built based on the recent past which is a much more useful prior than the entire history of the epidemic. So this simple, but important change leads to the following:\n",

    "$$ P(R_t|k_t) \\propto {\\displaystyle \\prod^{T}_{t=T-m}}\\mathcal{L}\\left(k_t|R_t\\right) $$\n",
